    <h1>Skills and Qualifications</h1>

    <h2>Mastering the Art of Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      As a professionally qualified web developer, my expertise lies in the holy
      trinity of web development: <strong>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>.
      These technologies have been my guiding lights since my teenage years, and
      I continue to embrace them in my current role at Sataku. JavaScript, in
      particular, holds a special place in my heart as it was the first
      programming language I ever learned. I eagerly explore the latest language
      features and techniques, constantly seeking optimal solutions to
      programming challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crafting search-engine-optimized (SEO) code and designing responsive web
      layouts are areas where I excel in HTML and CSS. To elevate the quality of
      my CSS, I rely on <strong>Sass (SCSS)</strong>, which not only improves
      code organization but also enhances its cleanliness. While I may not be an
      expert in atomic CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or component-based ones
      like Bootstrap, I grasp their underlying concepts and recognize their
      potential advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, web accessibility is a topic of immense importance. As a
      psychologist with a specialization in health and rehabilitation, I
      strongly believe that disability arises from an environment that fails to
      cater to the unique needs of individuals. As a result, I am deeply
      committed to providing well-structured, semantic HTML, thoughtful color
      schemes, clear font choices, and optimized elements for screen readers to
      ensure an inclusive user experience.
    </p>
