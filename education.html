    <h1>Education and Academic Achievements</h1>
    <p>
      Throughout my educational journey, I embarked on a diverse range of
      subjects that have shaped the person I am today. From my early foray into
      the world of technology to my pursuit of understanding the complexities of
      human behavior, each step has been a transformative experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always had a fondness for tinkering with computers. As my
      fascination with technology grew, so did my passion for web development,
      leading me to explore this field more deeply over the years. My
      introduction to the world of programming began at the tender age of eleven
      when I created my very first HTML document. Soon later, I started writing
      small websites for my friends and family and even took on more significant
      projects, such as redesigning my primary school's official website.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012, my innocent hobby took a more serious turn when I enrolled in a
      leading electronic technical school with a strong emphasis on mathematics
      and information technology. During this period I acquired a diverse set of
      technical skills and knowledge, including expertise in algorithms, data
      structures, databases, servers, networks, Linux, and software development.
      Along the way, I gained proficiency in various programming languages,
      while also mastering essential programming paradigms and design patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 2016 marked a significant milestone as I graduated with the
      highest GPA in my class and earned professional qualifications in the
      development of web applications and database administration. Furthermore,
      I achieved an outstanding score of 98% in the advanced-level computer
      science exam.
    </p>
    <p>
      While pursuing further education in information technology seemed like a
      natural progression, I made a well-considered decision to take a different
      path after completing the first semester of applied computer science
      studies at Bydgoszcz University of Science and Technology. The allure of
      psychology was undeniable, and I believed it was essential to take a
      temporary break from the programmer's journey to gain fresh perspectives
      and open my mind to new horizons. This period of self-discovery allowed me
      to better understand myself and the people around me, and it has
      undoubtedly influenced the person I am today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transitioning into the field of psychology, I embarked on a five-year
      journey at Kazimierz Wielki University, culminating in earning a master's
      degree in psychology in 2022 with the highest GPA. Throughout my academic
      pursuit, I served as the prefect of the year, demonstrating strong
      leadership and organizational skills. My scientific achievements were
      recognized through consistent scholarships, and I actively engaged in
      various scientific clubs, holding roles such as member, president, and
      vice president. I even had the privilege of representing the Student
      Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time studying psychology, I actively contributed to over fifteen
      research projects, delving into diverse topics such as psychometrics,
      motherhood and parenting, alcohol addiction, aggression, work, depression,
      and even the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, I engaged in studies
      related to cognitive and neurological psychology, exploring subjects like
      attention, working memory, and reasoning. Some of these projects received
      accolades at national and international scientific conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, I actively participated in research projects supported by the
      Ministry of Science and Higher Education through various grant programs.
      Working in the EEG laboratory, I conducted individual sessions with
      participants and processed EEG signals using the MATLAB programming
      environment. Furthermore, I had the privilege of co-authoring two posters
      presented at international scientific conferences in Prague and Warsaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my scientific pursuits, I found fulfillment in volunteering for
      various educational campaigns, where I contributed as a workshop leader,
      designer, and conductor. My graphic design skills also came to the fore as
      I created logos and posters for several organizations, including the
      Faculty of Psychology. Moreover, I explored my artistic side by being part
      of a choir, performing at different cultural and charity events.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my fourth year of psychological studies, I decided to delve into
      another passion of mine: physical education. Simultaneously pursuing this
      field alongside psychology, I also engaged in research and served as the
      vice president of one of the student's scientific clubs. Additionally, I
      acquired professional certifications as a personal trainer and fitness
      instructor, expanding my knowledge in the realm of physical training.
      Although I completed the first year of physical education studies with the
      highest GPA, I ultimately chose to resign from the program to focus on my
      psychological master's thesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my final year of psychological studies, I was honored to be selected as
      a grant laureate, sponsored by Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. This
      exceptional opportunity allowed me to participate in a transformative
      student exchange program at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences.
      The experience not only enriched my academic journey but also deepened my
      understanding of Scandinavian culture and philosophy, while significantly
      improving my English fluency.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic and research accomplishments culminated in the prestigious
      Award of the Rector of Kazimierz Wielki University, recognizing me as the
      Best Graduate and Student of the academic year 2021/2022. Additionally, my
      dedication and hard work were acknowledged with an award for producing the
      best master's thesis in the field of psychology. Based on this work, I
      wrote
      <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.17951/lrp.2022.41.4.53-76"
        >a scientific article that was published in the esteemed Lublin
        Pedagogical Yearbook</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all these years of diverse academic pursuits and self-discovery, I
      have come full circle and returned to my first love: programming and web
      development. Today, I work as a front-end developer, combining my passion
      for technology with the invaluable insights gained from my educational
      journey. The fusion of my critical thinking skills from psychology and my
      technical expertise enables me to approach software development with a
      unique and holistic perspective, crafting intuitive and user-centric
      digital experiences. I am excited to continue growing in this
      ever-evolving field and to embark on new challenges that lie ahead.
