    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>
      Throughout my professional journey, I have been fortunate to explore a
      wide range of fields, each contributing to my growth as an individual and
      a professional. From my experience in a vibrant rich media network to
      freelancing in web development, working with a material-building company,
      and delving into internships in IT support and psychology, each
      opportunity has enriched my skill set and shaped my perspective.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience in a Vibrant Rich Media Network: Sataku, Sarigato</h2>
    <p>
      Joining <a href="https://sataku.com/">Sataku</a>, a division of the
      esteemed
      <a href="https://grupasarigato.com/" hreflang="pl">Sarigato Group</a> and
      Poland's largest rich media network, in May 2023 has been a thrilling
      journey for me. As a dedicated front-end developer, I've been fully
      immersed in the world of programming, animating, optimizing, and testing
      interactive ads in collaboration with an exceptionally talented graphic
      team. Our collective efforts reach hundreds of thousands of viewers,
      delivering captivating marketing campaigns for some of the world's leading
      brands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working as part of a cohesive team of developers, I utilize JavaScript,
      HTML, and Sass (SCSS) to bring designs to life. Ensuring quick loading
      times and seamless performance across various devices and browsers is of
      utmost importance to me. My pursuit of pixel-perfect precision ensures
      that our interactive elements align flawlessly with the creative designs,
      offering an unparalleled experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my most gratifying contributions has been initiating an exciting
      internal project to automate the creation of rich media. Crafting a
      sophisticated automation script in Node.js, complemented by rigorous Jest
      unit tests, this project has the potential to significantly enhance our
      programmers' daily workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, by leveraging JavaScript, PHP, and Twig, I have actively
      participated in developing a campaign administration panel and
      distribution system that plays a pivotal role in advancing the company's
      product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my core responsibilities, I take great pride in supporting charity
      foundations under Sarigato, leveraging my technical knowledge to
      positively impact our communities.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Development and Freelancing: Kociołek and More</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my academic journey, I embraced the world of freelancing and
      took on diverse web development projects. One particular work that stands
      out in my portfolio is the creation of
      <a href="https://kociolekbydgoszcz.pl/" hreflang="pl"
        >a home page for Kociołek</a
      >, a delightful local cafe and buffet. From the very inception of the
      project, I wholeheartedly owned the design and development process.
      Employing an array of cutting-edge technologies like TypeScript, React,
      Remix, HTML5, and Sass (SCSS), I crafted an online presence that resonated
      with the cafe's unique charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sole developer and designer for Kociołek, I shaped everything from
      the brand colors and a distinctive logo to engaging graphics, captivating
      photos, and appealing fonts. My keen attention to detail ensured that the
      page layout not only impressed visually but also offered seamless
      user-friendliness. With a focus on performance optimization, the website
      delivered a smooth experience across all devices, particularly on mobile.
      Implementing best SEO practices further boosted the cafe's online
      visibility, elevating its search engine ranking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond web development, I also took charge of acquiring and configuring a
      custom domain while seamlessly integrating the page with Google's business
      profile. This not only solidified Kociołek's online identity but also
      enhanced its visibility in the local community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Witnessing the positive impact of my work on Kociołek's online presence
      ignited a deeper passion for crafting digital experiences and tackling new
      challenges in the realm of web development and design.
    </p>

    <h2>Growth and Learning at Protektor</h2>
    <p>
      During my technical school years, I embarked on an enriching journey with
      Protektor, a prominent material-building company. Over nearly two years, I
      served as a dedicated web and PrestaShop developer, showcasing my
      versatility and eagerness to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sole developer, I successfully designed and developed the company's
      official website using a combination of JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
      Although <a href="https://protektor-polska.pl/">Protektor’s website</a> is
      no longer maintained, it stands as a testament to my dedication and
      commitment to delivering exceptional digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond web development, my "jack of all trades" approach led me to engage
      in various tasks. I took on the challenge of creating a customized
      PrestaShop online store, adapting its theme, and integrating new
      functionalities. Moreover, I provided crucial support in configuring the
      company's local network, PCs, and printers. My role also involved product
      image preparation for the Allegro e-commerce platform using Photoshop,
      showcasing my ability to tackle diverse challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protektor experience not only deepened my passion for web development
      and design but also instilled in me a strong sense of self-reliance and
      the drive to seek creative solutions to any challenge that came my way.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploring Diverse Fields: Internships and Beyond</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond my web development work, I engaged in several internships in
      diverse fields. During a professional internship at IQOR Global Services,
      I served as an IT support and network administrator. My responsibilities
      included diagnosing and resolving operating system issues, maintaining the
      company's network, and providing invaluable IT support to the employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to IT-related internships, I also ventured into the world of
      psychology through student practices at a private psychological and
      psychiatric center, as well as a senior daycare center. During these
      experiences, I honed my skills in conducting cognitive assessments using
      the Vienna Test System 8, a sophisticated computer system for measuring
      and training cognitive and motor functions. Additionally, I led cognitive
      training sessions and organized group activities for the elderly,
      fostering a positive impact on their well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      These diverse internships have broadened my skill set and provided me with
      valuable insights into different fields.
