    <h1>Projects Showcasing My Expertise</h1>

    <h2>Diverse Rich Media Creations at Sataku</h2>
    <p>
      During my time at Sataku, I had the opportunity to create numerous rich
      media projects for some of the world's most prominent brands. You can
      explore a showcase of these works in
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKJrZD672CQ"
        >our recent showreel</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Streamlining Workflow with Node.js Automation at Sataku</h2>
    <p>
      One of my recent internal projects at Sataku is an exciting venture
      focused on enhancing our programmers' daily workflow. Leveraging Node.js
      and Jest unit testing, this automation script simplifies repetitive tasks
      related to positioning graphic elements and generating HTML and SCSS code
      during rich media production.

    <h2>
      Kocio≈Çek: Crafting a Captivating Home Page for a Charming Local Cafe
    </h2>
    <p>
      For this freelance project, I took complete ownership of the design and
      development process, employing cutting-edge technologies like TypeScript,
      React, Remix, HTML5, and Sass (SCSS) to craft an online presence that
      resonated with the unique charm of the cafe. Using Git and GitHub, I
      efficiently managed
      <a href="https://github.com/saitamason/kociolek-remix"
        >the project's code</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sole developer, I shaped everything from the brand colors and a
      distinctive logo to graphics, photos, and appealing fonts. My keen
      attention to detail ensured an impressive visual layout and a seamless
      user experience. By focusing on performance optimization, I achieved an
      exceptional Lighthouse score, providing a smooth browsing experience
      across all devices. Furthermore, implementing best SEO practices
      significantly boosted the cafe's online visibility, elevating its search
      engine ranking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although using Remix and React for this project might have been seen as
      overkill, I managed to strike a balance, delivering a lightweight and
      performant website while gaining valuable experience with these
      technologies.

    <h2>Remix Expenses: Empowering Personal Expense Management</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/saitamason/remix-expenses">Remix Expenses</a>
      is a full-stack application that enables efficient management of personal
      expenses, including adding, removing, and analyzing data. The application
      boasts JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and relies on a MongoDB
      database. Combining server-side rendering (SSR) with single-page
      application (SPA) functionality ensures both performance and convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating this application, I acquired in-depth knowledge of the Remix
      framework, from routing pages and implementing server-side code to
      handling errors and styling with CSS. Moreover, the project allowed me to
      sharpen my TypeScript and React skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Natio: An Educational SPA with MVC Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/saitamason/natio">Natio</a> is a personal
      project designed from scratch, offering users an educational experience by
      exploring countries and their neighbors, saving favorites, and tracking
      the progress of discovered nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This single-page app (SPA) is written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and
      Sass (SCSS), following the model view controller (MVC) architecture, and
      efficiently fetches data from the REST Countries API. With a fully
      responsive design, Natio guarantees compatibility with mobile devices. One
      of its unique visual features is the dynamically changing background
      color, calculated based on the colors of each country's flag. Moreover, I
      implemented a custom search functionality, enabling users to easily find
      countries without needing to input the whole name or diacritics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing Natio allowed me to master the process of creating an MVC
      application with vanilla JS, providing valuable experience outside the
      convenience of using a framework like React.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Natours: A Full-Stack App with Authentication, Authorization, and CRUD
      Operations
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/saitamason/natours-fullstack">Natours</a> is a
      comprehensive full-stack application created as part of a course, offering
      authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations for managing trips on
      behalf of a fictional traveling company. This ambitious project
      incorporates Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Several
      libraries, such as helmet, jsonwebtoken, axios, bcryptjs, sharp, and
      nodemailer, have been employed. The app also utilizes server-side
      rendering (SSR) with Pug.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of creating Natours provided me with invaluable learning
      opportunities, marking my first full-stack project and significantly
      expanding my skill set. Based on the knowledge from this project, I went
      on to create a Node.js back-end for
      <a href="https://github.com/saitamason/pumpal-backend-nodejs"
        >my own workout application (work in progress)</a
      >. This exciting venture has allowed me to further delve into backend
      development and gain hands-on experience in building applications that
      handle data, authentication, and user interactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Forkify: A Convenient SPA for Searching and Adding Recipes</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/saitamason/forkify">Forkify</a> is a
      feature-rich SPA designed for searching and adding recipes. As part of a
      course, this app connects to a RESTful API and is built using vanilla JS,
      Sass (SCSS), HTML, and the MVC architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application boasts several useful features, including basic search
      abilities, recipe addition (without validation), and the ability to save
      recipes as favorites.

        >a stunning portfolio</a
      >
      using Astro, a static page generator, along with HTML and CSS. This
