    <h1>Dawid Le Hai's Personal Website</h1>
    <p>
      I am a programmer specializing in front-end web development, dedicated to
      writing clean, green, and secure code while prioritizing accessibility,
      privacy, and responsive design. My skill set includes JavaScript, HTML,
      and CSS, along with proficiency in React and Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from my passion for programming, I am also a sports enthusiast with
      a keen focus on strength training, bodybuilding, and calisthenics.
      Furthermore, I enjoy music production, where I explore various electronic
      genres and occasionally experiment with singing or rapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond these pursuits, I take pleasure in dancing to good music, immersing
      myself in the beauty of nature, and embracing a minimalist lifestyle.
      Additionally, I am deeply committed to upholding ethical practices,
      preserving the environment, and promoting open-source software.
